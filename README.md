Lane Detection Using Raspberry Pi and OpenCV ðŸš—ðŸ’»

This repository contains the implementation of a **Lane Detection system** using **Raspberry Pi** and **OpenCV**. The project leverages real-time video processing to identify lanes, making it a crucial component in autonomous driving and robotics applications.

Features
- Real-time video capture and processing.
- Lane detection using OpenCV's advanced image processing techniques.
- GPIO integration for motor control using Raspberry Pi.
  
 How It Works
1. Captures video from the Raspberry Pi camera.
2. Processes frames to identify lanes using edge detection and contour mapping.
3. Uses GPIO to control motors based on lane positioning.
